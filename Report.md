# Final Project Report

**Project URL**: TODO

Our project seeks to examine the state of police brutality in America and understand what evidence is there of bias and injustice in the system itself. Are certain racial groups more likely to be victim of a police brutality incident? Are there any community indicators, such as violent crime levels, that can tell us anything about the rates of police brutality in those communities? Not only do we look at this from the perspective of the victim, but we also examine the view of police brutality from the perspective of the perpetrator. Are the policies that are implemented to help prevent police brutality successful in lowering levels of police killings? On top of simply implementing policies, are police officers being held accountable?
Our solution uses publicly available data to best uncover insights relating to the previously asked questions. Throughout the course of the project, we conduct discourse on not only the associations we uncovered, but also the limitations that come with the state of availability with police data.

## Introduction

Systemic racism is ingrained in many of Americaâ€™s longstanding institutions. With the recent killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, there has been widespread attention to the prevalence of police brutality and its disproportionate focus on Black Americans. Not only does police brutality result in the senseless killings of so many individuals in this country but it also impacts the communities in which such killings occur. 

## Related Work

There have been previous efforts to understand the racial disparity of police brutality as well as efforts to make police data on policies publicly available. Specific efforts, such as the [Use of Force Project](http://useofforceproject.org/#project), exist to educate the public on what policies are implemented in specific police departments across the country, but there wasn't a deep dive into specific cities and the local impacts of those policies. Additionally, the [Police Data Initiative](https://www.policedatainitiative.org/) helps give access to datasets on Police Brutality incidents in individual cities, but there is no analysis done to see any patterns over time. Our project sought to bridge this gap by combining information on implemented policies in specific cities and visualizing the police department's response to that, in coordination with the data to help dive into specific case studies of individual cities.
